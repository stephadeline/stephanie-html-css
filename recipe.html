Preparation
Grill the Chicken:
Season chicken on all sides with salt in a medium bowl. Add vinegar and garlic and toss to coat. Let sit 15 minutes.
Prepare a grill for high heat and brush grate lightly with oil. Grill chicken, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 165°F, 12–15 minutes. Let cool.
Do Ahead: Chicken can be grilled 4 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and chill.
Make the Romesco:
Lightly brush grill grate with vegetable oil. Grill peppers over high heat, turning occasionally, until skins are blackened and blistered all over, 15–20 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let sit until cool enough to handle.
Remove skins and seeds from peppers; discard. Purée peppers, garlic, vinegar, almond butter, olive oil, salt, and cayenne in a blender until smooth. Transfer to a small bowl .
Do Ahead: Peppers can be grilled 4 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and chill. Romesco sauce can be made 4 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and chill.
Assemble the Salad:
Thinly slice chicken. Transfer to a large bowl. Add lettuce, cucumbers, onion, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper and toss to combine. Pour oil and lemon juice over and toss to coat.
Spread about 1/4 cup romesco sauce across each plate, then top with salad. Sprinkle with paprika, if using.
